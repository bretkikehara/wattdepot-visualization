Each WattDepot sensor shows the state of each WattDepot sensor such as running, stopped, or waiting depending on the animation. When a sensor sends information to the WattDepot server, a network animation reflects the communication. Color and size indicate the level of energy and power consumption based on a geographical context such that this application could be deploy in a residential area as well as a university while scaling correctly.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
